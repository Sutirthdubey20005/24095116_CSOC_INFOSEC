# üõ°Ô∏è PicoCTF - Information Challenge: Uncovering Hidden Secrets

## Challenge Overview:

The "Information" challenge presents us with a single file: `cat.jpg`. The core task is to examine this file thoroughly to uncover a hidden flag. This forces us to think beyond simple file inspection and delve into deeper analysis techniques.

Here's a step-by-step guide to solving the "Information" challenge.

### Objective: Find the hidden flag in `cat.jpg`

üéØ **Goal:** Discover the `picoCTF` flag concealed within the `cat.jpg` image.

* **Initial File Verification:**
  Before diving deep, it's good practice to verify the file type and look for any immediate anomalies.

  * **Commands (for verification, though not strictly necessary to find the flag):**

    ```bash
    file cat.jpg
    hexdump -C cat.jpg | head
    binwalk cat.jpg
    ```

  * **Explanation:**

    * `file cat.jpg`: Confirms the file type (e.g., `JPEG image data`).

    * `hexdump -C cat.jpg | head`: Shows the hexadecimal and ASCII representation of the file's beginning, useful for spotting file headers.

    * `binwalk cat.jpg`: A firmware analysis tool that can identify embedded files or data within other files.

  * **Observation:**
    These commands confirm that `cat.jpg` appears to be a legitimate JPEG image, without any obvious embedded files.

* **Analyzing Image Metadata:**
  When dealing with image files, the metadata (EXIF data) is a common place for information to be hidden. This includes details like author, camera model, date taken, and sometimes custom fields.

  * **Tool:** An image viewer or editor (e.g., Gwenview, GIMP, Photoshop) that allows viewing metadata.

  * **Steps:**

    1. Open `cat.jpg` with your preferred image viewer/editor.

    2. Navigate to the "Properties," "Details," or "Metadata" section of the image.

  * **Observation:**
    Upon inspecting the metadata, a peculiar string is found in the **`Licence`** field: `cGljb0NURnt0aGVfbTN0YWRhdGFfMXNfbW9kaWZpZWR9`. This string's format (alphanumeric characters, often ending with `=`) strongly suggests it might be Base64 encoded.

* **Decoding the Suspicious String:**
  Given the suspicion of Base64 encoding, the next logical step is to decode the string.

  * **Command:**

    ```bash
    echo cGljb0NURnt0aGVfbTN0YWRhdGFfMXNfbW9kaWZpZWR9 | base64 -d
    ```

  * **Explanation:**

    * `echo cGljb0NURnt0aGVfbTN0YWRhdGFfMXNfbW9kaWZpZWR9`: Prints the Base64 encoded string to standard output.

    * `|`: Pipes the output of `echo` as input to the next command.

    * `base64 -d`: Decodes the input from Base64.

  * **Result:**
    Executing this command reveals the hidden flag.

* **Answer (The Flag):** ` echo cGljb0NURnt0aGVfbTN0YWRhdGFfMXNfbW9kaWZpZWR9 | base64 -d
picoCTF{the_m3tadata_1s_modified}`
