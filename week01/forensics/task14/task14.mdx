# üõ°Ô∏è CSOC InfoSec Forensics - Advent of Cyber 2023, Day 8, Task 14: Digital Forensics with Autopsy

This writeup covers the solutions for **Advent of Cyber 2023, Day 8, Task 14**, focusing on basic digital forensics using a tool like Autopsy. The goal is to analyze a forensic image to uncover hidden information, malware artifacts, and validate image integrity.

## WALKTHROUGH

Here are the questions and the steps taken to find the answers within a forensic analysis environment (e.g., Autopsy).

### Q#1: What is the malware C2 server?

üéØ **Goal:** Identify the Command and Control (C2) server used by the malware.

* **Explanation:**
  To find the C2 server, you typically navigate through the file system within the forensic image. Malware often leaves configuration files or logs that contain its C2 address. In this scenario, the C2 server information was found by exploring a "deleted" folder and opening a specific text file.

* **Answer:** `mcgreedysecretc2.thm`

### Q#2: What is the file inside the deleted zip archive?

üéØ **Goal:** Determine the name of the executable file contained within a deleted ZIP archive.

* **Explanation:**
  Forensic tools allow you to recover and examine deleted files. By locating the deleted ZIP archive and attempting to open or extract its contents within the forensic environment, you can identify the files it contained. The tool should allow you to view the contents without fully restoring the archive to the live file system.

* **Answer:** `JuicyTomaToy.exe`

### Q#3: What flag is hidden in one of the deleted PNG files?

üéØ **Goal:** Extract a hidden flag (string) embedded within a deleted PNG image file.

* **Explanation:**
  This task involves steganography or data embedding. After identifying the `portrait.png` file, you would typically use the forensic tool's hex viewer. Searching for common flag formats (like `THM{`) within the raw hexadecimal data of the image file can reveal hidden strings that are not visible in the image itself.

* **Answer:** `THM{byt3-L3vel_@n4Lys15}`

### Q#4: What is the SHA1 hash of the physical drive and forensic image?

üéØ **Goal:** Verify the integrity of the forensic image by calculating and comparing its SHA1 hash with the original physical drive's hash.

* **Explanation:**
  Forensic best practices require verifying the integrity of acquired images. Most forensic tools provide a function to calculate cryptographic hashes (like SHA1) of the drive or image. This hash acts as a digital fingerprint. By comparing the hash of the acquired image with the hash of the original source (if available), you can confirm that no data was altered during the imaging process. This feature is usually found under a "Verify Drive/Image" or "Hash Calculation" option.

* **Answer:** `39f2dea6ffb43bf80d80f19d122076b3682773c2`
