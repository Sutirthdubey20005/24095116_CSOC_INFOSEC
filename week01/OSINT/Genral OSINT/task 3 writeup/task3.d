Walkthrough: Solving Gralhix’s Exercise 003
Challenge Summary
In this exercise, we’re shown a photo from April 2017 depicting Mohamed Abdullahi Farmaajo, the President of Somalia at the time, meeting with Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, the President of Turkey. The catch: the exact location where the photo was taken isn't mentioned in the article that originally published it.

Our goal is to determine:

The name of the location

Its geographic coordinates

Step 1: Identifying the Location
Given this was an official state visit, the most reasonable starting point is to investigate Turkey’s major government buildings — particularly those used for diplomatic meetings. A quick search using the phrase “Turkey presidential palace” quickly points us in the right direction.

Sure enough, matching the photo to reference images reveals that it was taken at Turkey’s Presidential Complex, officially known as the Cumhurbaşkanlığı Külliyesi, located in Ankara.

Step 2: Pinpointing the Coordinates
Now that we’ve identified the building, the next challenge is to determine where exactly within the complex the picture was taken.

Initial clues from user-uploaded photos on Google Earth Pro suggest the entrance is on the west side, but a closer examination using Google Maps reveals that the main ceremonial entrance is actually on the eastern side of the complex.

📌 Tip: Never fully rely on the compass directions in user-uploaded photos — they can often be off. Use landmarks and building layouts to verify orientation.

By comparing Google Maps imagery with photos taken on the ground, we can locate the exact entrance area featured in the task photo. The camera's point-of-view aligns with the eastern gate, facing toward the western part of the plaza.

Conclusion
After marking the position directly in Google Maps, I right-clicked on the correct point near the ceremonial gate and noted down the coordinates. For this exercise, the location pin lands approximately at:

📍 Coordinates: 39.9311, 32.7995
📍 Place Name: Presidential Complex, Ankara, Turkey (Cumhurbaşkanlığı Külliyesi)
