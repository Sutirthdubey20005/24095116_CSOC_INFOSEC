The post dates back to January 19, 2023, and its wording suggests that the event was recent. This means that if the photo appeared on the internet long before this post, the photo used by the journalist is from a different event.

At first, I tried looking up the photo on Google Image Search to no avail. However, Yandex Image Search led me to a us navy article from 2006, confirming that the journalist used a photo from a different event.
