Objective:
Identify the key details of a photo taken at a tropical resort on an island.

Step I: Identifying the Resort
To start, I ran a reverse image search using Google Images. Among the top results was a Facebook profile linked to a place called Oan Resort. A quick look through its photo collection confirmed that the same picture featured in the query was posted there as well.

Step II: Pinpointing the Island‚Äôs Location
Digging deeper into ‚ÄúOan Resort,‚Äù I found its official website, which contains a video introducing the resort‚Äôs location. According to the video, the resort is located within the Federated States of Micronesia, specifically in Chuuk State, inside the Chuuk Lagoon.

I then opened Google Maps and navigated through Chuuk Lagoon. Eventually, I found a location marker labeled ‚ÄúOan Resort,‚Äù which confirmed the island's presence.

Zooming into this spot, I retrieved the approximate coordinates of the island:
üìç Latitude:  7.363490796,
üìç Longitude: 151.755772589

To explore the surroundings more effectively, I also used Google Earth. This allowed me to visualize the landscape and nearby formations in 3D, helping confirm the resort's positioning.

Step III: Determining the Camera Direction
Next, I examined the landscape in the background of the original image. Notably, some nearby islets and the shape of the atoll give clues about which way the photo was taken.

By adjusting the Google Earth view and comparing it to the image, I was able to match the shapes of the landmasses. Toggling the view with the arrow keys and using the timeline feature to roll back to satellite imagery from around 2021‚Äì2022 showed the sandbanks and coastlines in a form that closely resembled the original photo.

From this analysis, it became clear that the camera was facing toward the northwest when the image was captured.

Final Summary:
Resort Name: Oan Resort

Island Coordinates: 7.363490796, 151.755774589

Camera Direction: North-West
