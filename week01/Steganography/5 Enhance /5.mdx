When I perform the binwalk command on that image with extraction, I get a loop of files in which the same ZIP file is repeatedly extracted. At last, I checked the hex of that file and discovered it is actually a PNG. So, I edited it as a PNG using a hex editor. After changing and manipulating it in FotoForensics, a website used for image steganography, I got the flag.
