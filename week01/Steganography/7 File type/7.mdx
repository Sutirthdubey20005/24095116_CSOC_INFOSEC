üõ°Ô∏è CSOC InfoSec - Week 1, Steganography Challenge 7: File Type Analysis
For Week 1, Steganography Challenge 7 of the CSOC InfoSec program, we tackled the 'File Type' challenge from PicoCTF 2022. This challenge focused on identifying disguised file types and extracting hidden data.

Objective: Uncover the hidden flag by identifying and extracting nested files
üéØ Goal: Determine the true nature of Flag.pdf and extract the picoCTF flag.

Step 1: Initial File Type Verification

Command:

file Flag.pdf

Observation: It was a shell archive text, not a PDF.

Step 2: Executing the Shell Archive

Commands:

cp Flag.pdf Flag.sh
chmod +x Flag.sh
./Flag.sh

Observation: A new file named flag was generated.

Step 3: Unpacking the First Layer - ar Archive

Command:

file flag

Observation: It was a current ar archive.

Command (for extraction):

binwalk -e flag

Observation: A folder _flag.extracted was created, containing a file named 64.

Step 4: Decompressing the Second Layer - gzip Compressed Data

Command:

file _flag.extracted/64

Observation: It was gzip compressed data.

Command (for extraction):

binwalk -e _flag.extracted/64

Observation: Another extracted folder was created, containing a file also named flag.

Step 5: Decompressing the Third Layer - lzip Compressed Data

Command:

file _64.extracted/flag

Observation: It was lzip compressed data.

Command (for extraction):

lzip -d -k _64.extracted/flag

Observation: This created flag.out.

Step 6: Decompressing the Fourth Layer - LZ4 Compressed Data

Command:

file flag.out

Observation: It was LZ4 compressed data.

Command (for extraction):

lz4 -d flag.out flag2.out

Observation: This created flag2.out.

Step 7: Decompressing the Fifth Layer - LZMA Compressed Data

Command:

file flag2.out

Observation: It was LZMA compressed data.

Commands (for extraction, with rename):

mv flag2.out flag2.lzma
lzma -d -k flag2.lzma

Observation: This created flag2.

Step 8: Decompressing the Sixth Layer - LZOP Compressed Data

Command:

file flag2

Observation: It was LZOP compressed data.

Commands (for extraction, with rename and output):

mv flag2 flag2.lzop
lzop -d -k flag2.lzop -o flag3

Observation: This created flag3.

Step 9: Decompressing the Seventh Layer - LZIP Compressed Data

Command:

file flag3

Observation: It was LZIP compressed data.

Command (for extraction):

lzip -d -k flag3

Observation: This created flag3.out.

Step 10: Decompressing the Eighth Layer - XZ Compressed Data

Command:

file flag3.out

Observation: It was XZ compressed data.

Commands (for extraction, with rename):

mv flag3.out flag4.xz
xz -d -k flag4.xz

Observation: This created flag4.

Step 11: Final Flag Retrieval - ASCII Text and Hex Decoding

Command:

file flag4

Observation: It was ASCII text.

Command (to view content):

cat flag4

Observation: The content was a long hexadecimal string.

Tool: CyberChef (or any hex decoder).

Process: Converted the hex string to text.

Result (The Flag): picoCTF{f1len@m3_m@n1pul@t10n_f0r_0b2cur17y_347eae65}
