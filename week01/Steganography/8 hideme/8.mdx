ðŸŽ¯ Goal: Uncover the picoCTF flag hidden within the provided image, which was initially suspected to be a PNG.

Step 1: Initial File Download and Verification
I downloaded the challenge file and verified its type.

Command:

file <downloaded_file_name>

Observation:
The file command confirmed it was a PNG image.

Step 2: Searching for Hidden Data with zsteg
I used zsteg to look for hidden data within the PNG.

Command:

zsteg <downloaded_file_name>

Observation:
zsteg did not immediately reveal the flag or obvious hidden text, suggesting an embedded file.

Step 3: Carving for Hidden Files with foremost
Since zsteg didn't work, I used foremost to extract any embedded files.

Command:

foremost <downloaded_file_name>

Explanation:
foremost extracts recognized file types and saves them in an output folder.

Observation:
In the output folder, I found a zip file named 00000077.zip.

Step 4: Unzipping the Retrieved Archive
I unzipped the extracted zip file.

Command:

7z x 00000077.zip

Observation:
A new folder named secret was created.

Step 5: Final Flag Retrieval from the Nested Image
I entered the secret folder to find the final artifact.

Process:
Inside the secret folder, I found another image file (e.g., flag.png).

Command (to view the image):

xdg-open flag.png

Observation:
Opening flag.png revealed the flag clearly written within the image itself.

Result (The Flag): (The actual flag would be visible in the flag.png image.)
